# TransXEnergy



## About the project
Growing global energy demands require increasingly efficient energy transmission. Existing infrastructure such as smart homes and electric vehicles (EVs) can be adapted into power transmission networks for greater efficiency, but there are insufficient incentives motivating participation from smart home and EV owners, reducing the effectiveness of the scheme and its environmental impact. We propose an auction and blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading platform. The platform allows users to place their bids and also energy sale prices. Next, a matching algorithm which utilises production and consumption forecasts matches buyers with their respective sellers as closely and effectively as possible. Lastly, the blockchain is used to securely record and store the transactions.
